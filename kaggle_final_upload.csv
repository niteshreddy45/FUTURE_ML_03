I did,Do you know where your back up battery is located? It may look like this. ^JAY
Yes,Are you able to reset the router? ^NHP
Yes. I unplugged and plugged everything back in too.,Is it doing this on your other TV's as well? ^ACM
Nope. A few states away actually. The airbnb we're in doesn't have espnews so we signed in with our Verizon account to go to espn3 and watch. Doesn't allow us. Which I don't get since I know we have espnews back home,Are you connected to WiFi at all? Some shows are not available outside of your home network as well. ^RMD

Done.. No changes,When you tune to channel 506 is that what your guide is saying should be on 466? ^RMD
"Yes. Guide for 466, the programs are airing on 506. 506 guide doesn't correspond to anything",Seems that channel is in the process of moving. It will match up again within the next couple of days. ^RMD
"No, it's not selectable on guide or directly entering #. It goes to 455 instead",Is this happening on all TV's? It sounds like it could be a setting on the guide that could be skipping it if its not a part of your paid service. ^JAY
Yes,So are you seeing a black screen with the channel information at the bottom? ^JAY
"No message, can't tune to it at all",Does that channel appear on your guide? ^NHP
Correct,What message are you receiving when you tune to this channel? ^JAY
"Channel 506 is WBIN-TV, it was 466 which data is right",Are you stating that 466 is not available to you?  ^ADP
can you fix the guide data for channel 506 WBIN-TV. The correct info is listed on channel 466 still which is no longer available,"The broadcaster (WBIN) gives us what to put on the guide, we cannot change it.  There might be an out of Sync issue however.  Unplug an unscrew the COAX on the back of your router.  Wait 2 min then plug back up.  Once the internet comes back do the same to the cable box. ^ACM"

Not a problem at SEA closer to 30 min",I'm thinking since we only have that one flight a day. The plane comes in from Seattle. Deplanes and re-boards with new guests. All the crew and agents are ready to go! We like flying and we love being on time! -Tara
Not sure. In the back of the plane but heard an announcement about doors closing. Still sitting at the gate past departure time. Finally turned on A/C,"Yeah, looks about 3 mins behind schedule.  -Tara"
why does flight 501 IND-SEA always have final boarding called at the listed START boarding time? Currently sitting at the gate with doors closed for 30+ min. Not the first time on this flight number,"Hey, do I understand that the flight is closed already? -Tara"
"Always appreciate the  gangsta bear to welcome me back home. , thoughts on keeping these friendly cuties?","Hey, great question, and I honestly knot sure if we will stay or go.  -Tara"
